\section{Thesis Organization}\label{sec:2.4}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\noindent The structure of the thesis is organized as follows:

\vspace{-0.8cm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item  In Chapter 3, a general review of the most important adaptive filters used for echo cancellation application is presented. %The chapter begins with the basic proportionate-type adaptive filters followed by $l_1$-norm and $p$-norm based sparse adaptive filters.
\vspace{-0.3cm}
  \item In Chapter 4, the proposed algorithm is presented. A review of the VSSLMS algorithm and a broad concept of the $p$-norm constraint are provided. The mean square convergence analysis and a stability criterion of the proposed algorithm are also carried out and presented.
\vspace{-0.3cm}
  \item In Chapter 5, an experimental study is provided in order to compare the performance of the proposed filter with other $l_1$-norm and $p$-norm based sparse adaptive filters  in the context of AEC.
\vspace{-0.3cm}
  \item In Chapter 6, conclusions and a discussion on possibilities for future work are provided.
\end{itemize}
